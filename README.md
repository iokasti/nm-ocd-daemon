Python script that downloads the Open cell ID csv.gz file and creates a MongoDB database.
The script should be run under specified time intervals (e.g. 3 days) in order to make sure the server has the updated list of cells.
Execution time(~6-8h) should be taken into consideration for the selected time interval.
